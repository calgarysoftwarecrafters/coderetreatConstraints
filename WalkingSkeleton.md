# Walking Skeleton

### Soundbyte:

Design a minimal end-to-end scenario, and iterate on it


### Details:



1. List the main architectural components of the system you are designing
2. Link them together in a walking skeleton. A walking skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, or even perform everything required, but it should touch each component you identified in the first step.
3. Draw out your walking skeleton and implement it with TDD.
4. Continue to build out from the initial walking skeleton


### Example:

A drive thru includes an Order Station, a Worker, an Order, a Cash Register, a Car and a Window.

The Walking Skeleton would be the smallest possible interaction between these pieces that we can use to link them together - like being able to have a Car drive through and receive a glass of water for free. \
Once the Walking Skeleton is TDD’d you can start building pieces off of it, like the ability for a Car to order more or not get their food if they don’t pay.
