#BDD
### Summary
Understand your use cases before you write your code

### Details
Before you write any code, think of an example of how a user might interact with your application. 
Write it out in English using the Given, When, Then syntax. For Example:

*Given* a player is looking at an empty board with no live cells
*When* they select a cell
*Then* that cell should become alive

Using TDD, write just enough code to fulfill that requirement. 

Write another requirement, and repeat the cycle until the game has been fully implemented
