# No Conditionals

### Summary:

No ifs, no switches or other conditionals. Use polymorphism and lookups instead.


### Details:

The goal of this constraint is to practise writing code with fewer logical paths, with only one execution path from request to response. 

Anything that will take a decision and create more execution paths is a conditional. Ternaries are not allowed.
