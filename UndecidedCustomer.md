# Undecided CustomerA

### Summary:

Your requirements will change as you are coding


### Details:

You are building the code for a customer who likes to change their mind. 

As part of your refactoring step, stop and think about how the customer might change the requirements on you. Analyse your design to see if you’ve made any assumptions that might make changing your code difficult. Try to improve your design to remove those assumptions.

Do not build anything the customer hasn’t asked for yet.

### Instructions:

After you have:


#### Completed the Cell

Pick a number between 1 and 4 and highlight your new constraint

1.  No change - the customer is happy with the cell and doesn’t want to change anything
2.  Hexagonal Cells - Each cell has 6 sides that connect it with other cells
3.  Age - The cell is aware of how many turns it has been alive. A cell can only be alive 3 times.
4.  Waffling - The customer decides that any change on requirements you have accomodated up to this point should be undone.

#### Implemented a "next turn"

Pick a number between 1 and 4 and highlight your new constraint

1.  No change - the customer is happy with the next turn and doesn’t want to change anything
2.  Waffling - The customer decides that any change on requirements you have accomodated up to this point should be undone.
3.  Age - The cell is aware of how many turns it has been alive. A cell can only be alive 3 times.
4.  Wrapping - The grid only goes to 100 and connects to 0. (0,0 also connects to 100, 100)

#### Completed the Board Output

Pick a number between 1 and 4 and highlight your new constraint

1.  No change - the customer is happy with the cell and doesn’t want to change anything
2.  Hexagonal Cells - Each cell has 6 sides that connect it with other cells
3.  Waffling - The customer decides that any change on requirements you have accomodated up to this point should be undone.
4.  Wrapping - The grid only goes to 100 and connects to 0. (0,0 also connects to 100, 100)
