# Campground Rules

### Summary:

You are required to stop and refactor before moving onto the next test


### Details:



*   Write a test
*   Watch it fail
*   Write some code to make it pass
*   Refactor: You must improve the code in some way, before you can write your next test.


### Example:

 Some useful refactors include:



*   Clearer naming
*   Extract a method to remove duplication or keep it small
*   Extract a class to respect the single responsibility principle
