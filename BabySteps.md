# Baby Steps

### Summary:

Step-by-step write small tests and make them pass


### Details:

1. Set up a source control repository

2. Set up a timer for a 2-4 minute interval

3. Write exactly one test and try to make it pass. If it is not passing before the timer rings, revert

4. Restart the timer

5. Refactor. If the refactor is not finished before the timer rings, revert. Otherwise, commit.

6. Restart the timer, go to step 3 again.
