# No Code

### Summary
Build an understanding of your domain and how to create an algorithm out of a set of requirements.

### Description
Use a jamboard, miro, or some other type of collaboration software that allows you to draw. In person, a piece of paper works too.
Create two columns and label them "Input" and "Output". On a separate section of the board/paper/collaboration software, make an empty space, and label it "Algorithm"

1. Read the requirements, and think of the simplest, dumbest possible input that could fit those requirements. With Game of Life, I find it useful to start with an empty 3x3 board.
2. Draw the input in the input column
3. Look at your algorithm. What output would it generate? Draw that in the output column. (If your algorithm is blank, it doesn't make any output)
4. Read the requirements again. Does the output in the output column match what the requirements are asking for? If not, what is the correct output? Replace any incorrect output with the correct output in the output column.
5. If your output was wrong, write out the steps you took to figure out the output in your Algorithm section. Make sure you list every single little step.
6. Pick the next simplest input to try, and repeat steps 2-6 until you've met all the requirements. (After an empty board, I like to try one cell)

### What is an Algorithm?
Computers do many things for us, but for every thing they do, we need to tell them how to do it. An algorithm is a set of instructions that allow a computer or a person to solve a problem.

### Why are small, simple steps important when writing up my algorithm?
Contrary to popular opinion, computers are not smart. Sometimes, they will try to do what you want, but completely misunderstand. Because of this, it's important that your instructions are as specific and relevant as possible.
