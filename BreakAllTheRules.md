### Summary:

Get to know bad code


### Details:

Think of the four rules of simple design:



1. Tests Pass
2. Donâ€™t repeat yourself
3. Express Intent
4. Keep it Small

Now do the opposite of that.

Sometimes, to fully internalize an idea, you need to intentionally do it the wrong way. You need to write the worst code possible, breaking as many rules as you can, while still solving the problem.
