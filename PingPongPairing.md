Switch driver and navigator on time or event


### Details:

There are two roles: Driver and navigator. 

The driver controls the keyboard and mouse, while the navigator collaborates. The driver and navigator switch regularly during the session. 


#### On time:

We suggest you rotate every 5 minutes

We suggest you rotate on the completion of any of the TDD cycles.

You can choose what works for you - either every 5 minutes, or on every test.
